# 👨‍🍳 ChefBot – AI Assistant for Inclusive Diningg.

ChefBot is an AI-powered virtual assistant designed to support restaurants and diners by offering personalized, safe, and inclusive food recommendations—especially for individuals with allergies, intolerances, and dietary restrictions.

## 🌟 Key Features

- **Dual-perspective design**: Helps both guests and staff save time and reduce stress.
- **Allergy-aware recommendations**: Matches diners with safe dishes using verified allergen matrices.
- **Multilingual support**: Ideal for tourists and expats.
- **Built with no-code tools**: Developed using Microsoft Copilot Studio, Power Automate, and AI-powered forms.
- **Smart landing page prototype**: Created with TailwindCSS and hosted via GitHub Pages.

## 💡 Problem It Solves
Guests with allergies often feel anxious and excluded when dining out. Staff spend too much time clarifying ingredients, which slows down service. ChefBot reduces risk and speeds up decision-making for both sides.

## 🎯 Target Users
- Diners with allergies or intolerances (e.g., gluten-free, lactose-intolerant, nut allergies)
- Health-conscious tourists or expats
- Restaurant staff seeking faster allergen communication

## 🚀 How It Works
1. Guest visits a landing page or scans a QR code at the table.
2. They input their dietary preferences and allergies.
3. ChefBot provides filtered, safe menu recommendations.
4. The system can escalate to human staff when needed.

## 🔐 Responsible AI & Safety
- Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture to avoid hallucinations
- Allergen tables as verified source-of-truth
- Default response: "Please confirm with staff" in ambiguous cases

## 📦 Tech Stack
- Microsoft Copilot Studio
- Azure AI Search + Content Safety
- GitHub Pages + TailwindCSS for MVP
- Optional integrations: Power Automate, SharePoint, Dynamics 365
